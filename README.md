# NucleoSite

NucleoSite is a Python-based application that leverages the PyQt5 framework to provide interactive geographical visualizations of dam locations across various states in India. Inspired by the Oak Ridge Siting Analysis for Power Generation Expansion (OR-SAGE), NucleoSite is tailored to address India's unique geospatial data and infrastructure planning needs.

## Project Background

India's initiative to reduce greenhouse gas emissions includes transitioning from coal-fired power plants to more sustainable nuclear power. This transition requires comprehensive assessment of potential sites based on environmental, geological, and infrastructural parameters. NucleoSite streamlines this process by providing robust visualization and data analysis tools.

## Development Objectives

- **GIS Tool Development:** Develop a GIS tool using PyQt5 that enables users to visualize dam locations and related data within a user-friendly interface.
- **Risk Analysis Features:** Implement features to analyze risk factors such as earthquake risk, water presence, and demographic data.
- **Reporting Capabilities:** Provide users with the ability to generate detailed reports from their analyses to aid in decision-making for infrastructure planning and environmental assessment.

## Features

- **Interactive Map Visualization:** Utilizes geospatial data to plot dam locations on a dynamic map, enhancing user interaction with functionalities for zooming and selecting specific dams for more detailed data.
- **Data Analysis Tools:** Incorporates layers like seismic risk, population density, and water body proximity for comprehensive risk and impact assessments.
- **Dynamic Reporting:** Allows for the generation and export of detailed PDF reports summarizing analytical findings.
- **Customizable Search Parameters:** Enables users to set specific analysis criteria and thresholds, tailoring outputs to specific needs.

## Technologies Used

- **Python:** Primary programming language for backend development.
- **PyQt5:** Used for developing the graphical user interface.
- **Matplotlib and GeoPandas:** Handle geospatial data management and plotting.
- **FPDF:** Integrated for PDF report generation.

## Development Process

- **Initial Setup:** Configured development environment, established a Git repository for version control, and installed necessary libraries.
- **UI Design:** Focused on ease of navigation and accessibility when creating the user interface.
- **Feature Implementation:** Developed and refined core functionalities like the interactive map and data integration.

## Challenges Encountered

- **Data Integration:** Required meticulous attention to detail and rigorous testing to ensure data accuracy.
- **UI Responsiveness:** Continuous optimization needed to maintain efficiency while handling large geospatial datasets.

## Current and Future Work

- **Current Features:** Include all planned functionalities such as interactive mapping and report generation.
- **Future Enhancements:**
  - **Predictive Modeling:** To forecast potential risks using historical data.
  - **Advanced Risk Assessments:** Integrate more complex risk evaluation algorithms.
  - **Data Updates:** Regularly update data layers to ensure ongoing relevance and accuracy.
