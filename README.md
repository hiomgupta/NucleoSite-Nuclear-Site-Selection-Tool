# NucleoSite - Nuclear Site Selection Tool

## Project Overview
NucleoSite is an innovative desktop application developed to assist in selecting optimal sites for nuclear facilities in India. The tool uses Python and PyQt5 to provide interactive geographical visualizations of dam locations, integrating extensive data analysis to effectively assess dam safety and environmental impacts.
